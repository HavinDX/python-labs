However, mastering the mechanics of Python functions gives you access to a whole lot of powerful tools that either don't exist or are uncommon or hard-to-use in other languages! The skills you learn through this lab will allow you to write (and debug) powerful Pythonic code quickly and easily!*\n",

For example, `functools.reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` calculates `((((1 + 2) + 3) + 4) + 5)`. The left argument, `x`, is the accumulated value and the right argument, `y`, is the update value from the sequence. If the optional `initializer` is present, it is placed before the items of the sequence in the calculation, and serves as a default when the iterable is empty. If `initializer` is not given and `iterable` contains only one item, the first item is returned.\n",

For instance, a collection of strings will be sorted alphabetically (by ASCII value), and a collection of tuples will sort lexicographically. Sometimes, however, we need to sort based on a custom key value. In Python, we can supply an optional `key` argument to `sorted(seq)`, `max(seq)`, `min(seq)`, or `seq.sort()` to determine the values used for ordering elements in a sequence. In Python, both `sorted(seq)` and `seq.sort()` are stable.\n",

    "### Automatic Caching\n",
    "In class, we wrote a decorator `memoize` that will automatically caches any calls to the decorated function. You can assume that all arguments passed to the decorated function will always be hashable types.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "def memoize(function):\n",
    "    cache = {}\n",
    "    def memoized_fn(*args):\n",

    "### Better Debugging Decorator\n",
    "The `debug` decorator we wrote in class isn't very good. It doesn't tell us which function is being called, and it just dumps a tuple of positional arguments and a dictionary of keyword arguments - it doesn't even know what the names of the positional arguments are! If the default arguments aren't overridden, it won't show us their value either.\n",

You'll have to investigate these attributes, but I will say that the `fn.__code__` code object contains a number of useful attributes - for instance, `fn.__code__.co_varnames`. Check it out! More information on function attributes is available in the latter half of Lab 3.*\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note\n",
    "There are a lot of subtleties to this function, since functions can be called in a number of different ways. How does your `print_args` handle keyword arguments or even keyword-only arguments? Variadic positional arguments? Variadic keyword arguments? For more customization, look at `fn.__defaults__`, `fn.__kwdefaults__`, as well as other attributes of `fn.__code__`."
